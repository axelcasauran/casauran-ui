# Skill: visual-regression

## When to load
Use for visual stories/snapshots.

## Preconditions
- Read `AGENTS.md`.
- Read active stage ledger.
- Load relevant policies and accepted ADRs.
- If implementation has begun, work from the approved independent specification.

## Hard rules
- deterministic scenarios.
- freeze animation/time/data.
- coverage without combinatorial explosion.
- interpret diff.

## Analysis checklist
- states.
- themes.
- RTL.
- forced colors.
- responsive.
- portals.

## Enterprise dimensions
Explicitly decide applicability of functionality, typing/API consistency, accessibility, keyboard/touch/IME, security, performance, theming/density, RTL/i18n, SSR/hydration/RSC, responsive/adaptive behavior, integration and documentation.

## Implementation discipline
- Identify owning capability/package before code.
- Reuse shared behavior without speculative abstraction.
- Keep public API provider-independent.
- Add regression coverage for discovered edge cases.
- Preserve one-public-component stage boundary.

## Forbidden shortcuts
- Copy reference implementation details.
- Weaken types/tests/validators.
- Add external runtime dependency outside dependency workflow.
- Complete a stage with undocumented or untested behavior.
- Begin another public component.

## Required records
Update the target spec/registry/stage evidence, tests and docs relevant to this skill.

## Definition of Done
Domain checklist and applicable project Definition of Done gates pass; `pnpm validate` succeeds; evidence is recorded.
